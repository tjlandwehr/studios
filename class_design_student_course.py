# Bonus Missions
# These classes are a bit more involved than the ones above. Youâ€™ll need to design and implement a 
# working Student class before the Course class can work appropriately. Make sure to use your Student 
# object within the Course object when it is appropriate to do so!

# Student
# A student has a name and student ID number. A student can record grades and will track how many 
# credits they have taken as well as their GPA. A student can also report what their class standing is 
# (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduated) based on the number of credits they have taken.

# Course
# A course has a name and course number. A course has a certain number of seats - once those seats are 
# filled, it is not possible for anyone else to take the course. A course has a roster of students (use your 
# student object!). A course can add a student (if there are open seats) or drop a student. A course can 
# report the average GPA of all students currently enrolled in the course.
